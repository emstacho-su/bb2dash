# bb2dash — Project State

> Updated upon each PR. Last update: **2026-09-10**, Phase 7 retrieval polish
> (`feat/retrieval-polish`, PR open) — matched-passage snippets, superseded-file filter,
> `part_range` repair, first `web/` test suite. Convention: see root `CLAUDE.md`.

## Where the product is

**Backend foundation complete and live; GUI v1 merged and deployed; retrieval polished.**
The Blackboard → Supabase pipeline, typed warehouse, document corpus, and two-tier search API
are all in prod. The Next.js hub app (`web/`) — all four v1 screens — is merged to `main`
(PR #4) and deployed to Vercel at `https://web-xi-ten-uy9xk6c6p0.vercel.app`; the owner account
has signed in successfully. RLS is owner-scoped (W-9, migration 020). Search now returns the
passage that matched (not the unit head) and hides superseded document versions by default
(Phase 7, live in prod). Still open from Phase 6: Stack's visual confirmation that screens
render live data, and disabling signups.

Live in prod (Supabase `bb2dash`, ref `goultdzqcavefcgnifdy`):

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| Raw capture | `bb_raw` crawls via `ingest/bb_crawler.js`; per-course maps at v2+; last pull 2026-09-08 |
| Typed warehouse | migrations 001–025 (repo numbering; see note below); 7 courses, 66 assignments, 145 sessions, planner tables |
| Effort model | migration 015 `effort_base` (19 types) + 016 `v_work_items` (152 items, effort + source) |
| Document corpus | 64 files (100% in Storage + local mirror + sha256), 534 text units extracted; 4 stale IST.466 files marked `superseded_by` (migration 022) → `v_bb_files_current` = 60 |
| Search: FTS | tsvector+GIN on file text / content / announcements; `search_file_text(…, p_include_superseded)` |
| Search: vectors | 1,195 gte-small embeddings (384-dim), 100% coverage; `part_range` = code points, audit clean (023); `match_file_text()`, `hybrid_search_file_text()` (`p_min_similarity` floor, single-source `similarity`, **matched-passage `snippet` + `part_no` + `snippet_source`**, superseded filter — migrations 012–013, 021, 024–025); keyword snippets come from the highest-`ts_rank` part that actually contains the query, ~27 ms at limit 12 |
| Edge functions | `embed-corpus` **v5** (resume-safe batch embedder; chunks by code point), `search` **v5** (retrieval API; **default mode: hybrid**; optional `min_similarity` floor; optional `include_superseded`) |
| Retrieval MCP | `mcp-server/` — stdio MCP server for Claude Code: `search_materials` (+ `include_superseded`) / `get_material_text` / `list_courses`; 86 vitest tests |
| GUI (`web/`) | Next.js 16 + TS, Supabase Auth, 4 screens (Today, Course, Materials, ⌘K search); deployed to Vercel; ⌘K shows `part N` on multi-part hits; **vitest harness** (39 tests, `queries.search.ts` ≥97% covered) |
| Auth | one user (`emstacho@syr.edu`, uid `fd0b7c9d…`) created; **RLS owner-scoped** (migration 020, W-9 done) — every authenticated policy is `auth.uid() = public.app_owner()`, owner resolved by email; signups still to be disabled |

## What has been done (by phase)

1. **Phase 1 — data syntax + syllabus seed** (pre-repo, 2026-09-02): schema design, 6 grading
   models as declarative rules, facts-vs-state separation, source/confidence on every row.
2. **Phase 2 — Blackboard capture** (2026-09-02/03): crawler over Ultra's internal JSON API,
   course maps, full file harvest + text extraction via bb-course-map / bb-course-pull skills.
3. **Phase 3 — audit + search schema** ([PR #1](https://github.com/emstacho-su/bb2dash/pull/1),
   merged 2026-09-09): extract audit (`AUDIT_2026-09-09.md`), backfilled drifted migrations
   005–009, migration 010 search layer.
4. **Phase 4 — embedding POC** ([PR #2](https://github.com/emstacho-su/bb2dash/pull/2),
   merged 2026-09-09): gte-small via edge functions, $0; corpus fully embedded; eval verdict
   in `EVAL_EMBEDDING_POC.md` — hybrid hit@1 9/10 vs FTS 1/10; hybrid is the hub default.
5. **Phase 5 — Retrieval MCP** ([PR #5](https://github.com/emstacho-su/bb2dash/pull/5), merged
   2026-09-09, by the concurrent session): migrations 012–013 (`hybrid_search_file_text` gains a
   `p_min_similarity` vector-arm floor and a real, single-source `similarity` column), `search`
   edge function v3 (forwards `min_similarity`, de-dups vector parts per unit), and `mcp-server/`.
6. **Phase 6 — GUI v1** (`feat/gui-v1`, [PR #4](https://github.com/emstacho-su/bb2dash/pull/4)
   open, 2026-09-09/10): stack decided Next.js on Vercel + Supabase Auth, no Docker (Docker-first
   local plan superseded — see reconciliation doc). Migrations **014–019** (planner columns,
   effort model, work items, course display, files-current, sync contract — renumbered from
   012–017 on 2026-09-10 after merging main; see
   `docs/planning/41_RECONCILIATION_gui_vs_retrieval-mcp.md`). Four screens built by parallel
   Opus workers in isolated worktrees: Today (14-day effort tracker), Course (week rail + lanes +
   AI policy), Materials (signed-URL Open ladder), ⌘K hybrid search (0.80 "keyword match" label +
   speaker-notes scrubbing; verified compatible with search v3 — same result columns). Full tree
   typecheck + build green after the merge. Recovered local planning round in `docs/planning/`.
   Merged 2026-09-10 (`aef5dee`); W-9 RLS hardening landed right after as migration 020.
7. **Phase 7 — Retrieval polish** (`feat/retrieval-polish`, 2026-09-10; brief and frozen
   contract in `docs/planning/50_PHASE7_retrieval_polish.md`, evidence in
   `51_W10_VERIFICATION.md`). Two Opus workers on their own branches/worktrees, PM-integrated.
   **021** `matched_snippets`: `hybrid_search_file_text` returns the passage that matched —
   `ts_headline` (plain text) over the best embedding part's slice for FTS-arm hits, that slice's
   head for vector-only hits — plus `part_no` / `snippet_source`; all three search RPCs gain
   `p_include_superseded boolean default false`, filtering before ranking. **022**
   `supersede_stale_files`: seeds `bb_files.superseded_by` for the four stale IST.466 documents
   (schedules 58→16→66, 40→66; roster 35→37), matched by sha256, justified from `notes`/`bb_raw`.
   **023** `part_range_repair`: clamps the one overrun (text 276, an astral-plane emoji) and
   asserts the invariant. `embed-corpus` v5 chunks over code points (root cause). `search` v4
   accepts `include_superseded`. MCP server + ⌘K palette consume the new fields; `web/` gets its
   first test harness (vitest + Testing Library). `/code-review` (high) then confirmed against
   prod that 021 cut keyword-arm snippets from the *vector-best* part, which often did not contain
   the keyword (5 of 10 rows for "attendance policy"); **024** `snippet_fixes` picks a part whose
   slice covers the tsquery (whole-unit headline otherwise; `part_no` = the part the snippet was
   cut from, null for the fallback), trims torn leading words, keeps `[notes]` labelled when the
   marker precedes the slice, limits before the joins, and makes the keyword-mode headline plain
   text; **025** `snippet_part_rank` ranks covering parts by `ts_rank` (vector-best part breaks
   ties). `/security-review`: no findings. Live-verified after 025: "final exam date" on the
   16-part IST.323 syllabus returns part 16 ("Scheduled Final Exam Day 12/15/26") instead of the
   instructor's office hours; "attendance policy" has 0 of 10 snippets missing the keyword;
   superseded schedules absent by default, present with the flag. Tests: web 40, mcp-server 88.

**Migration numbering note.** Prod's `schema_migrations` recorded the GUI migrations under their
pre-reconciliation names (`012_planner_columns` … `017_sync_contract`) next to main's
`012_hybrid_similarity` / `013_hybrid_similarity_single_source`. Same DDL, live once; the repo
names it 014–019. This is a name-level artifact, NOT drift — a rebuild in README order reproduces
prod. **Do not re-apply 014–019.**

## Remaining to fully close the GUI phase

0. ~~Reconcile `feat/gui-v1` with main's Retrieval-MCP phase~~ — done 2026-09-10 (merge + renumber).
0a. ~~Merge PR #4 to `main`~~ — done 2026-09-10 (`aef5dee`); `main` is the single source of truth.
1. ~~Create the Vercel project~~ — done; deployed at `https://web-xi-ten-uy9xk6c6p0.vercel.app`
   (Root Directory `web`, the two `NEXT_PUBLIC_` env vars). Owner has logged in.
2. **Stack: visual sign-off** — confirm the Today/Course/Materials/search screens render live
   data end-to-end (login works; this is the last unconfirmed link).
3. **Stack: disable signups** (Supabase Auth → Sign In / Providers) before the URL is shared.
   Also set Supabase Site URL to the Vercel origin for password-reset/confirmation email links.
4. ~~**W-9: RLS hardening**~~ — **done 2026-09-10** (migration 020). The 21 permissive
   `authenticated using(true)` policies (STATUS earlier estimated ~25; the real count is 21) are
   now `auth.uid() = public.app_owner()`, plus `storage.objects` `bb_files_auth_all` owner-scoped
   (bucket + owner). `app_owner()` resolves the owner **by email** (recreation-proof). The five
   anon INSERT-only paths and service_role are untouched. Verified: owner sees all rows, any other
   uid sees zero, anon insert + `search` edge function both still work. **Signups still to be
   disabled** (item 3) before any public URL carries data.

## Slotted for the future (backlog, rough priority order)
1. Recurring crawl cadence (weekly + before class days) + `bb_raw` diffing into typed tables;
   capture the Blackboard iCal feed URL for cheap due-date sync. A crawl should also set
   `superseded_by` automatically when a content item's file is re-uploaded (022 did the
   historical four by hand).
2. Remaining near-duplicates outside the 022 scope: bb_files 17, 18/19, and IST.352 31/32/47
   (three variants of "Introduction to SA&D - Part 1"). Needs a general supersede rule.
3. Remaining data gaps: IST.323 Security-in-the-News group/date, IST.466 Group #3 slots,
   OCR for the two image-only files.
4. Test coverage beyond `queries.search.ts` in `web/` (Today/Course/Materials screens need a
   router + query-client harness); widen the vitest coverage `include` as screens gain tests.
5. Stored per-part `tsvector` on `bb_text_embeddings` (populated at embed time, backfilled from
   `part_range`): the only real speed-up for the keyword-snippet part selection, which today
   recomputes `to_tsvector` per covering part (hybrid at limit 12 ≈ 27 ms; fine, but grows with
   the corpus). Do it when the palette feels slow, not before.
6. Professional-side data (deferred by design).

## Known issues / operational notes

* Sandboxed Claude sessions cannot reach `*.supabase.co` (org egress policy) — invoke edge
  functions server-side via `pg_net` (`net.http_post`); pg_net is enabled and load-bearing.
* Edge CPU budget caps embedding at ~8–9 parts per invocation; `embed-corpus` resumes per-part.
* ~~`part_range` on text 276 is one char long~~ — fixed (023 + `embed-corpus` v5, Phase 7).
* `bb_raw` run 19 (2026-09-08 crawl) still lists the IST.466 "Wk2x" root item that the notes
  say was removed on 9/8 — the crawl ran earlier that day. Harmless; the next crawl clears it.
* Hybrid `snippet` length is a word budget (`MaxWords=40`, two fragments), not a char budget:
  observed 81–791 chars. Clients truncate for display.
* A matched-passage snippet cut from part ≥2 of a PPTX unit would start *after* the `[notes]`
  marker; since 024 the function prefixes `[notes] ` to such a snippet (and the whole-unit
  fallback headlines only the text before the marker) so the marker-based client scrubbers
  still label it. Verified on synthetic fixtures only — 51 units carry `[notes]` today and none
  is multi-part. The ingest cadence work (backlog 1) should re-run that check after every crawl.
* Hybrid keyword snippets recompute `to_tsvector` per covering part at query time: 27 ms at
  limit 12 on the 534-unit corpus. See backlog 5 for the stored-tsvector fix.
* Function search-path advisor warnings (pre-existing pattern) on the search RPCs.
* Never ship the service key to a browser; anon key is insert-only by design.
