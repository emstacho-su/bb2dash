# Phase 21 · W-64 (runner stream) · verification

Brief: `docs/planning/sprint-2/briefs/102_PHASE21_workspace.md` (frozen 2026-10-05).
Branch `feat/workspace-21-runner`, worktree `bb2dash-wt-21-runner`. Tasks 7, 10, 8, 9, 11, worked in
that order. Every command below is run from `workspace/` unless a line says otherwise. Host: Windows 11,
Git Bash, Node v24.19.0, npm 11.17.0; the package's `engines` floor is Node 22 (the image's base).

One section per task: the red run (the named test committed failing, before its code) and the green
run, each with its command and last lines.

## Task 7 · package scaffold, router and tier map (P-83)

Files: `workspace/package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.test.json`,
`vitest.config.ts`, `README.md`, `src/router.ts`, `src/tiers.ts`, `test/router.test.ts`,
`test/fixtures/router-cases.json`.

`tsconfig.test.json` is one file more than the brief's Files table lists. It is the `mcp-server/`
pattern: `tsconfig.json` is the build (`src/` only, emitted to `dist/`, the one config the image
copies), and `tsconfig.test.json` extends it for `npm run typecheck` over `src/`, `test/` and
`vitest.config.ts` with no emit.

### Red

Commit: the scaffold, the fixture and the test, with no `src/router.ts` or `src/tiers.ts`.

```
$ npx vitest run test/router.test.ts
 FAIL  test/router.test.ts [ test/router.test.ts ]
Error: Cannot find module '../src/router.js' imported from C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-runner/workspace/test/router.test.ts
 Test Files  1 failed (1)
      Tests  no tests
```

### Green

```
$ npx vitest run test/router.test.ts
 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  67 passed (67)
$ npm run typecheck
> tsc -p tsconfig.test.json
(no output, exit 0)
```

The fixture holds 56 cases: 18 `low`, 21 `high`, 17 `mid`; 11 of them are follow-ups (a prior tier
and at most 40 characters). The test asserts the floors itself (at least 30 cases, 8 per tier, 6
follow-ups), that the fixture holds acceptance steps 3 to 7 word for word, and that they route `low`,
`low`, `low`, `mid`, `high`.

How the rule's open words were read (the fixture is the executable form):

* Order: high, then low, then the follow-up rule, then mid. So "What about week 4?" after an Opus
  answer is `low` (a lookup cue), and "Draft it again" after a Haiku answer is `high`.
* A clause starts at the start of the prompt, after `. ? ! ; : ,` followed by white space, after a
  line break, and after `and` or `then`. `IST.323` is one word, not a sentence break.
* A polite lead-in is skipped before a clause's opening word is read (`LEAD_INS` in
  `src/router.ts`: please, can you, could you, would you, will you, help me, i need you to, i want
  you to, i'd like you to, let's, now, ok, okay, also, just, and, then). "Can you write a cover
  note" is `high`; without the skip it would open with "can" and fall to `mid`.
* "has no high verb" (the `low` rule) is read as: no `HIGH_VERBS` word anywhere in the prompt. So
  "What should I write for the GEO.103 reflection?" and "What is the plan for week 5?" are `mid`.
* Lengths are counted in code points after trimming, the way the database counts its 8000.
* A first question has no prior tier, so a short one ("ok thanks") is `mid`.
